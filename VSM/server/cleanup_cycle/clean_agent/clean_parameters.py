        Thread-safety notes:
            Each individual counter read is thread-safe (protected by its own lock).
            However, the overall snapshot is NOT atomic across all counters - values may
            be read at slightly different points in time if worker threads are actively
            updating counters.
            
            This is acceptable because:
            1. During execution: Used by progress monitor for periodic updates where
               approximate values are sufficient to show that work is progressing.
               Perfect consistency is not required for progress reporting.
            
            2. Final report: Called after all worker threads have stopped (after join()),
               so no concurrent modifications occur and the snapshot is consistent.
            
            The non-atomic reads provide a good balance between simplicity and the
            actual requirements of the system.
